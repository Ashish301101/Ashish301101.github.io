# Ashish H

a Backend and Full Stack Engineer at Egnyte with over 2 years of experience specializing in building and deploying end-to-end intelligent systems using Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Generative AI and robust scalable backend technologies.
I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics & Communication (Major) and Computer Science and Engineering (Minor) from [PES University](https://pes.edu/), where I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, applied machine learning and system design.\

At Egnyte, I spearheaded the end-to-end development of customer-facing Generative AI features, including the Global Copilot, by implementing a scalable microservices architecture. I also owned the 'Bring Your Own Model' (BYOM) feature from initial system design to its full deployment on Google Cloud Platform. To guarantee the reliability of all AI-generated responses, I established a robust automation framework using a Python and Pytest CI/CD pipeline, and I’ve also mentored interns on best automation and Agile practices to strengthen collaboration and improve sprint productivity.\

My journey extends beyond engineering into research contributions and applied innovation, with work published at various conferences, reflecting my passion for bridging advanced AI research with real-world applications.
