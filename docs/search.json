I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics & Communication (Major) and Computer Science and Engineering (Minor) from PES University, where I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, applied machine learning and system design.\n\nAt Egnyte, I spearheaded the end-to-end development of customer-facing Generative AI features, including the Global Copilot, by implementing a scalable microservices architecture. I also owned the ‘Bring Your Own Model’ (BYOM) feature from initial system design to its full deployment on Google Cloud Platform. To guarantee the reliability of all AI-generated responses, I established a robust automation framework using a Python and Pytest CI/CD pipeline, and I’ve also mentored interns on best automation and Agile practices to strengthen collaboration and improve sprint productivity.\n\nMy journey extends beyond engineering into research contributions and applied innovation, with work published at various conferences, reflecting my passion for bridging advanced AI research with real-world applications.\n\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\nJul 2025: Participated in Google Agentic AI Hackathon\nFeb 2024: Secured first place in Egnyte Hackathon 2024\nJul 2023: After successfully completing my internship, I joined as a FTE Software Engineer at Egnyte\nMay 2023: Presented paper on speech to speech translation with lip synchronization at ICICCS 2023\nJan 2023: Started my journey as a Software Engineer Intern at Egnyte\nNov 2022: 1st Runner-Up in The Kannada Hackathon\nDec 2022: Published research on non-sequential video indexing at ICACRS 2022.\nJun 2022: Joined as a Research Intern at Indian Institute of Science\nOct 2021: Secured 1st Runner-Up position at the HashCode 2K21 Hackathon hosted by PES Innovation Lab\nJul 2021: Presented and published research on modeling learner engagement in MOOCs at ICICC 2021.\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\nEgnyte\nSoftware Engineer | Jun 2023 -
