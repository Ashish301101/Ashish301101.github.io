##### **Sahayak - AI-Powered Teaching Assistant**
[Google Agentic AI Hackathon](https://ash301101.egnyte.com/dl/j8C9YfpY7VPq)

- Developed Sahayak, an AI-powered teaching assistant for Indian educators. I architected and built this platform using LangChain, LangGraph, Agentic AI and the Gemini API, creating a multi-agent system to support teachers in multi-grade, multilingual, and resource-constrained classrooms.\
- Implemented a four-agent architecture to handle key educational tasks: VidyaMitra (a multimodal teaching assistant), SmartEval (an automated grading system), ConceptCanvas (a visual content generator), and SelfEval (a performance tracking tool). This system enables real-time lesson planning, assessment creation, and educational content generation, streamlining teacher-assistant interactions.\

##### **Low Resource Speech-to-Speech Translation of English videos to Kannada with Lip-Synchronization**
[ICICCS 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10142228/proceeding)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10142578)

- Devised a speech-to-speech translation system with Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), Neural Machine Translation(NMT), Text to Speech(TTS), and lip-synchronization; achieved BLEU score of 85.26% for translation, MOS of 4.56 for lip-synced video, and MOS of 4.94 for synthesized audio, enabling seamless audio-visual alignment.\
